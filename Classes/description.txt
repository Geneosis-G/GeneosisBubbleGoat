[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]This idea may seems quite simple and pointless... But I really liked it because it was offering a cool way to provide floating platforms in this game :)
So I made the bubbles as solid semi-transparent spheres that will explode most of the time when something touch them. And I added a special conditions for goat players, to let them walk on top of the bubbles without exploding them ^^
When this was done, I thought I could add another fun feature which is to allow bubbles to merge with each other :D This is done by computing the total surface of two touching bubbles, then removing them and making a new bubble with that surface in their place.
The only really bad point in this mod is, as mentionned in the bugs section, the unexplained crash that happen when using this mod... I really have no clue what is causing it, and the logs are not helping at all to fix it -_-
